            <div>My Favorite lesson that we talked is about binary numbers because i was able to understand it and i find it so interesting like when were turning our name into a binary numbers.
                My first thought about this lesson was its going to be hard but when were discussing it i find it easy to understand. And i was amazed that 0 and 1 can become so awesome i did not know
                that what i'm watching from my cellphone and computer was from 1 and 0. his is why my favorite lesson is binary numbers.
